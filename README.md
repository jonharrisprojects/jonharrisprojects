### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm working on small PCB Projects and Escape Room type props and electronics.
### Some bits, whilst I host here on my github, will be available for purchase on PCBWay.com in the case of certain PCBS.
### I do like to test my hardware designs before hand, but I always advise no warranty is ever implied, and you try my projects at your own risk.

### I'll let you know more in the coming days.
### 10th March, 2022.

### PS - If you're looking for a USB Based Dragon's Lair scoreboard adaptor, I abandonned that project. Google's archiving is a nuisance at times.
